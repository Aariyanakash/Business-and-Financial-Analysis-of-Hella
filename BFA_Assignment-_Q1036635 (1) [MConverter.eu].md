**ABSTRACT**

Hella is one of the leading Auto motive parts manufacturing companies,
however a Business and financial analysis is done to get to know how the
company is really performing. The results are comparted to the
Continental AG which is also an Auto motive parts manufacturing company.
In Business analysis the SWOT and PESTLE analysis of both companies were
done and compared to get the whole picture about the company’s
situation, In Financial analysis I have done the Ratio analysis and the
results were compared between the companies. By this analysis we can get
how both the companies are performing and whether the main company
should concern about its competitor performance. In this study I have
analysed the impact of Covid on both companies and how they performed
after the post Covid. And for conclusion I have given my thoughts about
the companies and its performance and some suggestions for improving the
company.

**1.INTRODUCTION**

In this highly competitive market, it is crucial for businesses to
improve their understanding of business and financial terms in order to
assess their various financial operations. This information aids the
firm in analysing the commercial and financial market trends in the
cutthroat marketplace (Walker, 2009). Thus, the primary goal of this
report is to provide a comparison study that can assist in demonstrating
the differences between two firms that are active in the same sector.

In this study, I've chosen the MDAX-listed HELLA as the main company.
Additionally, Continental AG is chosen as the secondary company to help
demonstrate the comparison with Hella by employing trend analysis and
ratio analysis in order to compare performance.

This report starts with the introduction of both selected companies.
This report also highlights the business and financial performance of
both companies that define the company’s financial position and its
business strategies.

Moreover, the SWOT and PESTLE analysis is used to analyse the business
performance and the ratio analysis is also used in this report to
analyse the financial performance of the companies. For conducting the
comparison between both the companies, different ratios such as
liquidity ratio, efficiency ratio, profitability ratio, leverage ratio
and cash flow ratios and rate of returns are used.

1.  HELLA:

A multinational, family-owned business called HELLA GmbH & Co KGaA
(HELLA) designs and produces lighting and electronic systems for the
automotive industry. The company's headquarters are in Lippstadt,
Germany, and it was established on June 11th, 1899. Automotive,
Aftermarket, and Special Applications are its three main business
divisions. The Automotive segment creates, makes, and markets solutions
tailored specifically for automobiles. The automobile parts and
accessory trade, workshop supplies, and wholesale industry are all
included in the aftermarket category. Original equipment for special
purpose vehicles is included in the Special Application categories.

2.  CONTINENTAL:

Founded on October 8, 1871, CONTINENTAL AG is a holding corporation with
its headquarters in Hanover, Germany. Operating segments include Tires,
ContiTech, Interior, Powertrain, Chassis and Safety, and

intelligent systems to enhance driving safety and vehicle dynamics. The
Interior segment creates individual parts as well as a whole system for
connected mobility. Fuel consumption is minimized in the Tires segment
by lowering rolling resistance. The ContiTech department handles all
aspects of product development, manufacturing, and marketing for the
mining, automotive, machine, and plant engineering industries. The
Other/Consolidation division comprises holding, finance, and insurance
companies as well as centralized-controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.

**5. FINDINGS**

- The ROCE value of Hella is highly volatile, it was so high in 2019
  which is due to disposal of asset which is not a good sign but in 2020
  and 2021 it started increasing which is a good sign. But the ROCE
  value of Continental increased gradually which indicates a good usage
  of capital.

- ROS value of Hella is high on compared with Continental this shows
  that Hella is having large amount of operating profit contributing to
  its net sales which is positive for Hella.

- Asset utilisation ratio of Hella is high and moving in a positive way
  which shows they are good in utilising the asset to make revenue that
  Continental.

- Both the companies have an average of 25% as their Gross profit margin
  which is a good sign.

- The current ratio of both the companies are increasing over time which
  denotes they are increasing its current assets over time.

- Comparing with Continental, Hella is less funded with debt than equity
  which is a positive sign and Hella is reducing its debt periodically
  which makes Hella better than its competitor Continental.

- Hella is increasing its EBIT and reduced its interest expenses over
  time, that is they are good in paying its interest dues. The value is
  high on 2019 due to the interest and tax benefits.

- The stock turnover days of both the companies are increasing which
  denotes they are struggling to convert its inventory to sales this is
  not a good sign for both the companies.

- The account receivable days of Hella is decreasing periodically which
  denotes they are good in collecting the credit sales amount; however,
  Continental is not performing well in recollecting its credit sales.

- The account payable days of Hella is averagely maintained at 48 days
  which is better than Continental.

- The ROE of Hella is so volatile over the past three years, this
  denotes they are not consistent in producing returns with respect to
  equity. The high fluctuation is because of the change in equity. But
  Continental is performing good in that category and increasing returns
  constantly.

- The debt-to-equity ratio of both the companies are similar, they both
  have higher debt than equity and both are reducing it periodically.

- Hella is funded on an average of 60% in debt and 40% through equity
  where Continental is funded on average of 65% in debt and 35% in
  equity.

- Hella is highly leveraged than Continental which is like a
  double-edged sword, if they utilise the leverage properly it will be a
  positive scenario or else, they will face huge losses.

- By the P/E ratio we can easily find that Hella’s share prices are
  trading on a higher slab when compared to Continental.

- Both the companies are maintaining an average of 75% as there
  operating profit margin which is good.

- The net income margin of Hella jumps and drops drastically due to
  their asset disposal process and new debts which is a negative point
  for the firm, were Continental is increasing its net profit margin
  gradually.

- The cash inflow of Hella in 2019 and 2020 is due to new debts. But
  Continental have a good cash flow margin.

- The cash ratio of Hella is higher when compared to Continental and
  Hella is increasing the ratio over time which denotes they have
  increased its current assets.

- The OCF and FCF of both the companies are increasing over time.

- Hella is producing higher returns than Continental and the values are
  increasing periodically.

**6. CONCLUSIONS**

From the above findings we can clearly get the idea of how both the
companies are performing and their advantages and disadvantages.

6.1 From my analysis,

Hella shouldn’t have a concern about its competitor Continental due to
the following reasons.

- Hella have a world-wide network and majority of the sales are from
  Europe - 30%, Germany - 30%, Asia and America - 40%. But for
  Continental most of its sales is from Europe so Hella have a huge
  advantage.

- Hella’s main sales is from automotive parts mainly by sensors and
  lighting systems and integrated circuits but Continentals main product
  is tyres and advanced safety technologies.

- Hella have large alliances they have partnered with many new companies
  to develop new technologies and to extent their market which gives a
  great advantage to Hella.

I have analysed the post pandemic performance of both the companies and
found that Hella’s performance after pandemic is not stable that is
because of the new debts and asset disposals were Continental gave a
gradual improvement periodically.

After analysis the reports my suggestions for the companies are

- Hella should make some major changes in their asset and debt
  management systems. They should come up with better investment
  decisions.

- Continental is performing well and stable still they should come up
  with strategies to increase their sales and converting sales to net
  profit.
